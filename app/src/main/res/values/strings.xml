    <string name="about_this_study_sec_1_title">What is the study about?</string>
    <string name="about_this_study_sec_1">
        In the last century depression and mental health disorders among students and academics have been noted as a significantly increasing problem. Addressing this problem has become a key concern for several Universities.
        Recently a quite new branch of psychology, called positive psychology, rather than threating mental illness, has focused its attention more on personal growth and happiness. What is new with positive psychology is trying to make intervention to increase well-being since it has as side effect the decreasing of suffering. Happiness, also known as subjective wellbeing, has been defined as a combination of satisfaction of one\'s life with positive and negative emotional reactions.
        Positive psychology indicates that happiness can be affected and improved in different ways. Several daily external factors can contribute to the individual\'s overall well-being, such as physical activities, workload, mobility, social interaction, sleep quality,.. In order to improve our quality of life and increase our resilience to adversity, it\'s really important to keep track of their influence in our daily life. Traditionally well-being has been explored using questionnaires and interviews, this approach however presents several drawbacks, it\’s time consuming and difficult to manage in large scale. Nowadays people of different ages carry their smartphone all the time and interact with it several times per day. This makes smartphone an emerging and attractive option for collecting tones of daily data from users and environmental context, that can be analysed to get information of human\'s attitude, interests and health.

    <string name="about_this_study_sec_2">
        This study belongs to a Master\’s thesis project. The main goal of the project is to investigate, using  smartphones, which are the main factors  that affect the well-being  and to which extent they contribute to  the participants\' happiness changes over time. Researchers have been shown that depression contribute to a reduction of mobility. Based on that we have decided to focus our attention mainly on the correlation between location information and well-being changes.
        During the data collection some feedbacks will be provided to the users which can become more aware of their well-being changes.
